# Week 1: CSE 15L VScode, Remote Connection and Terminal Command tutorial
---

## Visual Studio Code Installation
(If you have VScode already installed, just kindly ignore this section and go onto the next step for remote connection)
First off, go to the Visual Studio Code website at (https://code.visualstudio.com/) and (at least in the Lord's year of 2023), the download link should be right in the middle of your webpage on a button colored with a stunning navy blue hue.

If your operating system is anything other than Windows, there is a dropdown arrow to the right of the icon where you can select a macOS (for Macs) or Linux installation. (Unless you know you need it, keep with the Stable build of VScode).

After going through the install progress, you should be able to get to a window with this layout (The default settings may very depending on any settings you mess around or any default system settings):

**Reminder**: If for some reason your install does not go through properly, idk, like, look it up on google or smth.

## Remote Connection
Courses in CSE utilize course-specific accounts for posterity, and other jobs in the field also similarly setup like in this tutorial. We'll use VScode's terminal function to remotely connect to a computer over the internet to do our work.

First off, for Windows users, install `git` for Windows, which will be necessary for our remote connection:

[Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)

*There's going to be a LOT of dialogue boxes but just stick to the default settings and mash through the *next* button on the bottom right. (Unless there is a specific function stated by your employer or professor)*

After that's installed, follow this tutorial to get `git bash` working on Visual Studio Code's terminal.
